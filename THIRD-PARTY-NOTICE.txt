This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# clipboard.js

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zenorocha/clipboard.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/zenorocha/clipboard.js)
![Killing Flash](https://img.shields.io/badge/killing-flash-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)

> Modern copy to clipboard. No Flash. Just 3kb gzipped.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/"><img width="728" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/16165747/a0f6fc46-349a-11e6-8c9b-c5fd58d9099c.png" alt="Demo"></a>

## Why

Copying text to the clipboard shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't require dozens of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of all, it shouldn't depend on Flash or any bloated framework.

That's why clipboard.js exists.

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install clipboard --save
```

Or if you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

First, include the script located on the `dist` folder or load it from [a third-party CDN provider](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/wiki/CDN-Providers).

```html
<script src="dist/clipboard.min.js"></script>
```

Now, you need to instantiate it by [passing a DOM selector](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-selector.html#L18), [HTML element](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-node.html#L16-L17), or [list of HTML elements](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-nodelist.html#L18-L19).

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn');
```

Internally, we need to fetch all elements that matches with your selector and attach event listeners for each one. But guess what? If you have hundreds of matches, this operation can consume a lot of memory.

For this reason we use [event delegation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687296/what-is-dom-event-delegation) which replaces multiple event listeners with just a single listener. After all, [#perfmatters](https://twitter.com/hashtag/perfmatters).

# Usage

We're living a _declarative renaissance_, that's why we decided to take advantage of [HTML5 data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) for better usability.

### Copy text from another element

A pretty common use case is to copy content from another element. You can do that by adding a `data-clipboard-target` attribute in your trigger element.

The value you include on this attribute needs to match another's element selector.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/#example-target"><img width="473" alt="example-2" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/9983467/a4946aaa-5fb1-11e5-9780-f09fcd7ca6c8.png"></a>

```html
<!-- Target -->
<input id="foo" value="https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js.git">

<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-target="#foo">
    <img src="assets/clippy.svg" alt="Copy to clipboard">
</button>
```

### Cut text from another element

Additionally, you can define a `data-clipboard-action` attribute to specify if you want to either `copy` or `cut` content.

If you omit this attribute, `copy` will be used by default.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/#example-action"><img width="473" alt="example-3" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000358/7df57b9c-6050-11e5-9cd1-fbc51d2fd0a7.png"></a>

```html
<!-- Target -->
<textarea id="bar">Mussum ipsum cacilds...</textarea>

<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-action="cut" data-clipboard-target="#bar">
    Cut to clipboard
</button>
```

As you may expect, the `cut` action only works on `<input>` or `<textarea>` elements.

### Copy text from attribute

Truth is, you don't even need another element to copy its content from. You can just include a `data-clipboard-text` attribute in your trigger element.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/#example-text"><img width="147" alt="example-1" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000347/6e16cf8c-6050-11e5-9883-1c5681f9ec45.png"></a>

```html
<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="Just because you can doesn't mean you should — clipboard.js">
    Copy to clipboard
</button>
```

## Events

There are cases where you'd like to show some user feedback or capture what has been selected after a copy/cut operation.

That's why we fire custom events such as `success` and `error` for you to listen and implement your custom logic.

```js
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');

clipboard.on('success', function(e) {
    console.info('Action:', e.action);
    console.info('Text:', e.text);
    console.info('Trigger:', e.trigger);

    e.clearSelection();
});

clipboard.on('error', function(e) {
    console.error('Action:', e.action);
    console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger);
});
```

For a live demonstration, go to this [site](https://clipboardjs.com/) and open your console.

## Tooltips

Each application has different design needs, that's why clipboard.js does not include any CSS or built-in tooltip solution.

The tooltips you see on the [demo site](https://clipboardjs.com/) were built using [GitHub's Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer-css/tree/master/modules/primer-tooltips). You may want to check that out if you're looking for a similar look and feel.

## Advanced Options

If you don't want to modify your HTML, there's a pretty handy imperative API for you to use. All you need to do is declare a function, do your thing, and return a value.

For instance, if you want to dynamically set a `target`, you'll need to return a Node.

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    target: function(trigger) {
        return trigger.nextElementSibling;
    }
});
```

If you want to dynamically set a `text`, you'll return a String.

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    text: function(trigger) {
        return trigger.getAttribute('aria-label');
    }
});
```

For use in Bootstrap Modals or with any other library that changes the focus you'll want to set the focused element as the `container` value.

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    container: document.getElementById('modal')
});
```

Also, if you are working with single page apps, you may want to manage the lifecycle of the DOM more precisely. Here's how you clean up the events and objects that we create.

```js
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');
clipboard.destroy();
```

## Browser Support

This library relies on both [Selection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) and [execCommand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) APIs. The first one is [supported by all browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=selection) while the second one is supported in the following browsers.

| <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/chrome.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Chrome logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/edge.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Edge logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/firefox.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Firefox logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/ie.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Internet Explorer logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/opera.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Opera logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/safari.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Safari logo"> |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 42+ ✔ | 12+ ✔ | 41+ ✔ | 9+ ✔ | 29+ ✔ | 10+ ✔ |

The good news is that clipboard.js gracefully degrades if you need to support older browsers. All you have to do is show a tooltip saying `Copied!` when `success` event is called and `Press Ctrl+C to copy` when `error` event is called because the text is already selected.

You can also check if clipboard.js is supported or not by running `ClipboardJS.isSupported()`, that way you can hide copy/cut buttons from the UI.

## Bonus

A browser extension that adds a "copy to clipboard" button to every code block on *GitHub, MDN, Gist, StackOverflow, StackExchange, npm, and even Medium.*

Install for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecopy/fkbfebkcoelajmhanocgppanfoojcdmg) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecopy/).

# Closest

Similar to jQuery's `$.fn.closest` and `$.fn.parents`.
Finds the closest parent that matches a selector.

## Installation

    $ npm install closest

## API

### `closest(element, selector, checkSelf)`

* element - will check this elements parents
* selector - CSS selector to match parents
* checkSelf - check `element`.
  If falsey, will begin with `element.parentNode` and is synonymous to `$.fn.parents`.
  Otherwise, it's `$.fn.closest`.

Example:

```javascript
var closest = require('cosest');

closest(document.body, 'html') === document.documentElement
closest(document.body, 'body', true) === document.body
closest(document.documentElement, 'html') == null
```

#### With the default base (`document`)

```js
delegate('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With an element as base

```js
delegate(document.body, '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With a selector (of existing elements) as base

```js
delegate('.container', '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With an array/array-like of elements as base

```js
delegate(document.querySelectorAll('.container'), '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

### Remove event delegation

#### With a single base element (default or specified)

```js
var delegation = delegate(document.body, '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegation.destroy();
```

#### With multiple elements (via selector or array)

Note: selectors are always treated as multiple elements, even if one or none are matched. `delegate()` will return an array.

```js
var delegations = delegate('.container', '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegations.forEach(function (delegation) {
    delegation.destroy();
});
```

# dom-iterator

  Feature-rich, well-tested Iterator for traversing DOM nodes. A better version of [NodeIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator). Travels in both directions.

  Can be used in node.js with [mini-html-parser](http://github.com/matthewmueller/mini-html-parser).

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install matthewmueller/dom-iterator

  With node.js:

    $ npm install dom-iterator

## Example

```js
var it = iterator(node);
var next;

while (next = it.next(Node.TEXT_NODE)) {
  console.log(next.nodeValue) // next textnodes after node
}
```

## API

### `iterator(node, root)`

Initialize an iterator starting on the `node`. Optionally you can
specify a `root` to limit your traversal to a particular subtree.
`root` must be either a parent or an ancestor of `node`.

```js
var it = iterator(el.firstChild, el)
```

### `iterator#next([expr], [n])`

Gets the next DOM `node`. If no `node` exists, return `null`.
You may pass an expression `expr`, to grab the first node that
matches `expr`.

Additionally, you can pass a number to select the `nth` node.
Defaults to `1` or the `1st` node.

```js
var node = it.next()
// select the 2nd element node we come across
var next = it.next(Node.ELEMENT_NODE, 2)
```

Here's a look at how the DOM is traversed:

![next](https://i.cloudup.com/kl80e5axNP.png)

### `iterator#prev()`, `iterator#previous()`

Gets the previous DOM `node`. If no `node` exists, return `null`.
You may pass an expression `expr`, to grab the first node that
matches `expr`.

Additionally, you can pass a number to select the `nth` node.
Defaults to `1` or the `1st` node.

```js
var node = it.prev()
// select the 2nd element node we come across
var prev = it.prev(Node.ELEMENT_NODE, 2)
```

Here's a look at how the DOM is traversed:

![prev](https://i.cloudup.com/EkaCyvdwvF.png)

### `iterator.select(expr)`

iterate over nodes that pass the expression `expr`. The `expr` can be an
enum, number, string or function. If it's a number, the `nodeType` is compared.

This function can be chained where all expressions are OR-ed.

```js
it.select(Node.ELEMENT_NODE)
  .select(8)
  .select('nodeValue == "sloth"')
  .select(fn)
```

This is saying:

> select all element nodes or comment nodes
> or nodes with the nodeValue "sloth" or
> nodes that pass the function `fn`.

### `iterator.reject(expr)`

iterate over nodes that do not pass the expression `expr`. The `expr` can be an
enum, number, string or function. If it's a number, the `nodeType` is compared.

This function can be chained where all expressions are AND-ed.

```js
it.reject(Node.ELEMENT_NODE)
  .reject(8)
  .reject('nodeValue == "sloth"')
  .reject(fn)
```

This is saying:

> reject all element nodes and comment nodes
> and nodes with the nodeValue sloth and
> nodes that pass the function `fn`".

### `iterator.revisit(revisit)`

You can also skip over elements you already visited, by setting `revisit` to false. By default, `revisit` is set to `true`.

```js
it.revisit(false);
```

Here's how that would change the iterator:

**it.next():**

![next](https://i.cloudup.com/VX6BbZEuzf.png)

**it.prev()**

![prev](https://i.cloudup.com/NEKe6F4EUX.png)

### `iterator.opening()`

Jump to the opening tag of an element. This is the default.

```js
var dom = domify('<em>hi</em>');
var it = it(dom).opening()
it.next() // 'hi'
```

### `iterator.closing()`

Jump to the closing tag of an element

```js
var dom = domify('<em>hi</em>');
var it = it(dom).closing()
it.prev() // 'hi'
```

### `iterator.peek([expr], [n])`

Sometimes you want to peek on the following or previous node without actually visiting it. With `peek` you can peek forward or backwards `n` steps. If no `n` is given, peek forward 1 step.

Peaking forward:

```js
it.peek(); // peek forward 1
it.peek(3); // peek forward 3 steps
```

Peaking backwards:

```js
it.peek(Node.ELEMENT_NODE, -3) // peek backwards 3 steps, only selecting element nodes
```

### `iterator.reset([newNode])`

Reset the iterator to the original `node`. Optionally pass a `newNode` to start at.

```js
it.reset();
```

### `iterator.use(fn)`

Add a plugin to the iterator.

## Run Tests

On the server:

```js
npm install
make test
```

Or in the browser:

```js
npm install
make test-browser
```

# domify

Turn HTML into DOM elements x-browser.

## Usage

Works out of the box in the browser:

```js
var domify = require('domify');

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  var el = domify('<p>Hello <em>there</em></p>');
  document.body.appendChild(el);
});
```

You can also run it in *node* and *iojs*. Just pass a custom implementation of `document`:

```js
var jsdom = require('jsdom').jsdom();

domify('<p>Hello <em>there</em></p>', jsdom.defaultView.document);
```

## Running tests

```
$ npm i -g component-test
$ make
$ component-test browser
```

# good-listener

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zenorocha/good-listener/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/zenorocha/good-listener)

> A more versatile way of adding & removing event listeners.

![good listener](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10718224/dfc25f6c-7b2a-11e5-9d3d-75b35e8603c8.jpg)

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install good-listener --save
```

Or bower, too.

```
bower install good-listener --save
```

If you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

###### Node (Browserify)

```js
var listen = require('good-listener');
```

###### Browser (Standalone)

```html
<script src="dist/good-listener.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Add an event listener

By passing a string selector [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/selector.html).

```js
listen('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

Or by passing a HTML element [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/node.html).

```js
var logo = document.getElementById('logo');

listen(logo, 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

Or by passing a list of HTML elements [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/nodelist.html).

```js
var anchors = document.querySelectorAll('a');

listen(anchors, 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

### Remove an event listener

By calling the `destroy` function that returned from previous operation [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/destroy.html).

```js
var listener = listen('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});

listener.destroy();
```

------------------------------------------------

Make a new hat rack. Call `rack()` repeatedly to generate new IDs which are
checked for collisions.

If `expandBy` is specified, increment `bits` by this amount if too many
collisions occur. If `expandBy` isn't specified, `rack()` will throw if too many
collisions occur during generation.

Optionally call `var id = rack(data)` to store `data` at the new ID.

You can get the data out again with `rack.get(id)` and set the data with
`rack.set(id, value)`.

# inferno-vnode-flags

Inferno VNode Flags is a small utility library for [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno).

Usage of `inferno-vnode-flags` should be limited to assigning `VNodeFlags` and `ChildFlags` when using creating vNodes.

## Install

```
npm install --save inferno-vnode-flags
```

## Contents

**VNodeFlags:**
- `VNodeFlags.HtmlElement`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentUnknown`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentClass`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentFunction`
- `VNodeFlags.Text`
- `VNodeFlags.SvgElement`
- `VNodeFlags.InputElement`
- `VNodeFlags.TextareaElement`
- `VNodeFlags.SelectElement`
- `VNodeFlags.Void`
- `VNodeFlags.Portal`
- `VNodeFlags.ReCreate` (JSX **$ReCreate**) always re-creates the vNode

**VNodeFlags Masks:**
- `VNodeFlags.FormElement` - Is form element
- `VNodeFlags.Element` - Is vNode element
- `VNodeFlags.Component` - Is vNode Component
- `VNodeFlags.VNodeShape` - mask for defining type


**ChildFlags**
- `ChildFlags.UnknownChildren` needs Normalization
- `ChildFlags.HasInvalidChildren` is invalid (null, undefined, false, true)
- `ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren` (JSX **$HasVNodeChildren**) is single vNode (Element/Component)
- `ChildFlags.HasNonKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasNonKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes non keyed (no nesting, no holes)
- `ChildFlags.HasKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes keyed (no nesting, no holes)

**ChildFlags Masks**
- `ChildFlags.MultipleChildren` Is Array

You can easily combine multiple flags, by using bitwise operators. A common use case is an element that has keyed children:

Inferno is an insanely fast, React-like library for building high-performance user interfaces on both the client and server.

## Description

The main objective of the Inferno project is to provide the fastest possible **runtime** performance for web applications. Inferno excels at rendering real time data views or large DOM trees.

The performance is achieved through multiple optimizations, for example:

- Inferno's own [JSX plugin](https://github.com/infernojs/babel-plugin-inferno) creates monomorphic `createVNode` calls, instead of `createElement`
- Inferno's diff process uses bitwise flags to memoize the shape of objects
- Child nodes are normalized only when needed
- Special JSX flags can be used during compile time to optimize runtime performance at application level
- Many micro optimizations

## Features

- Component driven + one-way data flow architecture
- React-like API, concepts and component lifecycle events
- Partial synthetic event system, normalizing events for better cross browser support
- Inferno's [`linkEvent`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/blob/master/README.md#linkevent-package-inferno) feature removes the need to use arrow functions or binding event callbacks
- Isomorphic rendering on both client and server with `inferno-server`
- Unlike React and Preact, Inferno has lifecycle events on functional components
- Unlike Preact and other React-like libraries, Inferno has controlled components for input/select/textarea elements
- Components can be rendered outside their current html hierarchy using `createPortal` - API
- Support for [older browsers](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno#browser-supports) without any polyfills
- defaultHooks for Functional components, this way re-defining lifecycle events per usage can be avoided

## Browser support
Since version 4 we have started running our test suite **without** any polyfills.
Inferno is now part of [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) open source program and we use their service for executing the tests.

InfernoJS natively supports the browsers listed below.

- [Isomorphic-UI-Benchmark](https://github.com/marko-js/isomorphic-ui-benchmarks)
- [1k Components](https://rawgit.com/infernojs/inferno/master/benchmarks/1kcomponents/index.html)

## Code Example

Let's start with some code. As you can see, Inferno intentionally keeps the same design ideas as React regarding components: one-way data flow and separation of concerns.

In these examples, JSX is used via the [Inferno JSX Babel Plugin](https://github.com/infernojs/babel-plugin-inferno) to provide a simple way to express Inferno virtual DOM. You do not need to use JSX, it's completely **optional**, you can use [hyperscript](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-hyperscript) or [createElement](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-create-element) (like React does).
Keep in mind that compile time optimizations are available only for JSX.

```jsx
import { render } from 'inferno';

const message = "Hello world";

render(
  <MyComponent message={ message } />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
Furthermore, Inferno also uses ES6 components like React:

```jsx
import { render, Component } from 'inferno';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Header!</h1>
        <span>Counter is at: { this.state.counter }</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

render(
  <MyComponent />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Because performance is an important aspect of this library, we want to show you how to optimize your application even further.
In the example below we optimize diffing process by using JSX **$HasVNodeChildren** to predefine children shape compile time.
Then we create text vNode using `createTextVNode`.

```jsx
import { createTextVNode, render, Component } from 'inferno';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Header!</h1>
        <span $HasVNodeChildren>{createTextVNode('Counter is at: ' + this.state.counter)}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

render(
  <MyComponent />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

### More Examples

If you have built something using Inferno you can add them here:

- [**Simple Clock** (@JSFiddle)](https://jsfiddle.net/pzmqLjo7/)


## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Inferno is by using [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app).

Alternatively, you can use the [Inferno Boilerplate](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno-boilerplate) for a very simple setup. For a more advanced example demonstrating how Inferno might be used, we recommend trying out [Inferno Starter Project](https://github.com/nightwolfz/inferno-starter) by [nightwolfz](https://github.com/nightwolfz/). For using Inferno to build a mobile app, try [Inferno Mobile Starter Project](https://github.com/Rudy-Zidan/inferno-mobile) by [Rudy-Zidan](https://github.com/Rudy-Zidan).

Core package:

```sh
npm install --save inferno
```

Addons:

```sh
# server-side rendering
npm install --save inferno-server
# routing
npm install --save inferno-router
```

Pre-bundled files for browser consumption can be found on [our cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/inferno):

Or on jsDelivr:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/inferno@latest/dist/inferno.min.js
```

Or on unpkg.com:

```
https://unpkg.com/inferno@latest/dist/inferno.min.js
```

### Creating Virtual DOM

#### JSX:
```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-inferno
```

#### Hyperscript:
```sh
npm install --save inferno-hyperscript
```

#### createElement:
```sh
npm install --save inferno-create-element
```

### Compatibility with existing React apps
```sh
npm install --save-dev inferno-compat
```

Note: Make sure you read more about [`inferno-compat`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-compat) before using it.

## Third-party state libraries

Inferno now has bindings available for some of the major state management libraries out there:

- Redux via [`inferno-redux`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/dev/packages/inferno-redux)
- MobX via [`inferno-mobx`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/dev/packages/inferno-mobx)
- Cerebral via [`cerebral-view-inferno`](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral-view-inferno)

## JSX

Inferno has its own [JSX Babel plugin](https://github.com/trueadm/babel-plugin-inferno).

## Differences from React

- Inferno is much smaller in size, `~8kb` vs `45kb` gzip. This means Inferno is faster to transfer over the network but more importantly, it is *much* faster to parse – this makes a big impact on mobile.
- Inferno is considerably faster than React. This doesn't apply to benchmarks only, but to real-world applications that companies have converted to Inferno from React as well. Ranging from 40% - 110% performance improvement with Inferno `1.0`. No other React-like library gets close to this performance gain over React.
- Inferno doesn't have a fully synthetic event system like React does. Inferno has a partially synthetic event system, instead opting to only delegate certain events (such as `onClick`).
- Inferno doesn't support React Native. Inferno was only designed for the browser/server with the DOM in mind.
- Inferno doesn't support string refs – although this can be enabled using `inferno-compat`. We don't recommend using them since they are the source of many memory leaks and performance issues in real-world apps. Stick with function callback refs instead.
- Inferno includes `render` on the main core package, rather than have an `InfernoDOM` package like React does. We used to do it that way, but we found people simply didn't like it given we don't support native. Furthermore, by not splitting them, we improved performance and bundle sizes.
- Inferno provides lifecycle events on functional components. This is a major win for people who prefer lightweight components rather than ES2015 classes.
- Inferno is able to use the React Dev Tools extensions for Chrome/Firefox/etc to provide the same level of debugging experience to the Inferno user via `inferno-devtools`.

## Differences from Preact

- Inferno is larger in size, `~8kb` vs `3kb` gzip. This means that Preact should parse faster than Inferno – if only slightly.
- Inferno has a partial synthetic event system, resulting in better performance via delegation of certain events.
- Inferno is *much* faster than Preact in rendering, updating and removing elements from the DOM. Inferno diffs against virtual DOM, rather than the real DOM (except when loading from server-side rendered content), which means it can make drastic improvements. Unfortunately, diffing against the real DOM has a 30-40% overhead cost in operations.
- Inferno fully supports controlled components for `input`/`select`/`textarea` elements. This prevents lots of edgecases where the virtual DOM is not the source of truth (it should always be). Preact pushes the source of truth to the DOM itself.
- Inferno provides lifecycle events on functional components. This is a major win for people who prefer lightweight components rather than ES2015 classes.

## Event System

Like React, Inferno also uses a light-weight synthetic event system in certain places (although both event systems differ massively). Inferno's event system provides highly efficient delegation and an event helper called [`linkEvent`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/blob/master/README.md#linkevent-package-inferno).

One major difference between Inferno and React is that Inferno does not rename events or change how they work by default. Inferno only specifies that events should be camel cased, rather than lower case. Lower case events will bypass
Inferno's event system in favour of using the native event system supplied by the browser. For example, when detecting changes on an `<input>` element, in React you'd use `onChange`, with Inferno you'd use `onInput` instead (the
native DOM event is `oninput`).

Available synthetic events are:
- `onClick`
- `onDblClick`
- `onMouseMove`
- `onMouseDown`
- `onMouseUp`
- `onSubmit`
- `onKeyPress`
- `onKeyDown`
- `onKeyUp`
- `onInput`
- `onChange`
- `onFocusIn`
- `onFocusOut`

### `linkEvent` (package: `inferno`)

`linkEvent()` is a helper function that allows attachment of `props`/`state`/`context` or other data to events without needing to `bind()` them or use arrow functions/closures. This is extremely useful when dealing with events in functional components. Below is an example:

```jsx
import { linkEvent } from 'inferno';

function handleClick(props, event) {
  props.validateValue(event.target.value);
}

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div><input type="text" onClick={ linkEvent(props, handleClick) } /><div>;
}
```

This is an example of using it with ES2015 classes:


```jsx
import { linkEvent, Component } from 'inferno';

function handleClick(instance, event) {
  instance.setState({ data: event.target.value });
}

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render () {
    return <div><input type="text" onClick={ linkEvent(this, handleClick) } /><div>;
  }
}
```

`linkEvent()` offers better performance than binding an event in a class constructor and using arrow functions, so use it where possible.


## Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.
In Inferno, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

We can combine the two by making the Inferno state be the "single source of truth". Then the Inferno component that renders a form also
controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by
Inferno in this way is called a "controlled component".

## Inferno Top-Level API

### `render` (package: `inferno`)

```javascript
import { render } from 'inferno';

render(<div />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Render a virtual node into the DOM in the supplied container given the supplied virtual DOM. If the virtual node was previously rendered
into the container, this will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary, to reflect the latest Inferno virtual node.

Warning: If the container element is not empty before rendering, the content of the container will be overwritten on the initial render.

### `createRenderer` (package: `inferno`)

`createRenderer` creates an alternative render function with a signature matching that of the first argument passed to a reduce/scan function. This allows for easier integration with reactive programming libraries, like [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) and [Most](https://github.com/cujojs/most).

```javascript
import { createRenderer } from 'inferno';
import { scan, map } from 'most';

const renderer = createRenderer();


// NOTE: vNodes$ represents a stream of virtual DOM node updates
scan(renderer, document.getElementById("app"), vNodes$);
```

See [inferno-most-fp-demo](https://github.com/joshburgess/inferno-most-fp-demo) for an example of how to build an app architecture around this.

### `createElement` (package: `inferno-create-element`)

Creates an Inferno VNode using a similar API to that found with React's `createElement()`

```javascript
import { Component, render } from 'inferno';
import { createElement } from 'inferno-create-element';

class BasicComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return createElement('div', {
        className: 'basic'
      },
      createElement('span', {
        className: this.props.name
      }, 'The title is ', this.props.title)
    )
  }
}

render(
  createElement(BasicComponent, { title: 'abc' }),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

### `Component` (package: `inferno`)

**Class component:**

```javascript
import { Component } from 'inferno';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    ...
  }
}
```

This is the base class for Inferno Components when they're defined using ES6 classes.

**Functional component:**

```javascript
const MyComponent = ({ name, age }) => (
  <span>My name is: { name } and my age is: {age}</span>
);
```

Another way of using defaultHooks.
```javascript
export function Static() {
    return <div>1</div>;
}

Static.defaultHooks = {
    onComponentShouldUpdate() {
        return false;
    }
};
```

Functional components are first-class functions where their first argument is the `props` passed through from their parent.

### `createVNode` (package: `inferno`)
```js
import { createVNode } from 'inferno';

createVNode(
  flags,
  type,
  [className],
  [...children],
  [childFlags],
  [props],
  [key],
  [ref]
)
```

createVNode is used to create html element's virtual node object. Typically `createElement()` (package: `inferno-create-element`), `h()` (package: `inferno-hyperscript`) or JSX are used to create
`VNode`s for Inferno, but under the hood they all use `createVNode()`. Below is an example of `createVNode` usage:

```javascript
import { VNodeFlags, ChildFlags } from 'inferno-vnode-flags';
import { createVNode, createTextVNode, render } from 'inferno';

const vNode = createVNode(VNodeFlags.HtmlElement, 'div', 'example', createTextVNode('Hello world!'), ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren);

// <div class="example">Hello world!</div>

render(vNode, container);
```

`createVNode` arguments explained:

`flags`: (number) is a value from [`VNodeFlags`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-vnode-flags), this is a numerical value that tells Inferno what the VNode describes on the page.

`type`: (string) is tagName for element for example 'div'

`className`: (string) is the class attribute ( it is separated from props because it is the most commonly used property )

`children`: (vNode[]|vNode) is one or array of vNodes to be added as children for this vNode

`childFlags`: (number) is a value from [`ChildFlags`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-vnode-flags), this tells inferno shape of the children so normalization process can be skipped.

`props`: (Object) is object containing all other properties. fe: `{onClick: method, 'data-attribute': 'Hello Community!}`

`key`: (string|number) unique key within this vNodes siblings to identify it during keyed algorithm.

`ref`: (function) callback which is called when DOM node is added/removed from DOM.


### `createComponentVNode` (package: 'inferno')
```js
import { createComponentVNode } from 'inferno';

createComponentVNode(
  flags,
  type,
  [props],
  [key],
  [ref]
)
```

createComponentVNode is used for creating vNode for Class/Functional Component.

Example:
```javascript
import { VNodeFlags, ChildFlags } from 'inferno-vnode-flags';
import { createVNode, createTextVNode, createComponentVNode, render } from 'inferno';

function MyComponent(props, context) {
  return createVNode(VNodeFlags.HtmlElement, 'div', 'example', createTextVNode(props.greeting), ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren);
}

const vNode = createComponentVNode(VNodeFlags.ComponentFunction, MyComponent, {
  greeting: 'Hello Community!'
}, null, {
  onComponentDidMount() {
    console.log("example of did mount hook!")
  }
})

// <div class="example">Hello Community!</div>

render(vNode, container);
```


`createComponentVNode` arguments explained:

`flags`: (number) is a value from [`VNodeFlags`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-vnode-flags), this is a numerical value that tells Inferno what the VNode describes on the page.

`type`: (Function/Class) is the class or function prototype for Component

`props`: (Object) properties passed to Component, can be anything

`key`: (string|number) unique key within this vNodes siblings to identify it during keyed algorithm.

`ref`: (Function|Object) this property is object for Functional Components defining all its lifecycle methods. For class Components this is function callback for ref.



### `createTextVNode` (package: 'inferno')

createTextVNode is used for creating vNode for text nodes.

`createTextVNode` arguments explained:
text: (string) is a value for text node to be created.
key: (string|number) unique key within this vNodes siblings to identify it during keyed algorithm.

```js
import { createTextVNode } from 'inferno';

createTextVNode(
  text,
  key
)
```


### `cloneVNode` (package: `inferno-clone-vnode`)

This package has same API as React.cloneElement

```javascript
import {cloneVNode} from 'inferno-clone-vnode';

cloneVNode(
  vNode,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```

Clone and return a new Inferno `VNode` using a `VNode` as the starting point. The resulting `VNode` will have the original `VNode`'s props with the new props merged in shallowly. New children will replace existing children. key and ref from the original `VNode` will be preserved.

`cloneVNode()` is almost equivalent to:
```jsx
<VNode.type {...VNode.props} {...props}>{children}</VNode.type>
```

An example of using `cloneVNode`:

```javascript
import { cloneVNode, createVNode, render } from 'inferno';
import { VNodeFlags } from 'inferno-vnode-flags';

const vNode = createVNode(VNodeFlags.HtmlElement, 'div', 'example', 'Hello world!');
const newVNode = cloneVNode(vNode, { id: 'new' }); // we are adding an id prop to the VNode

render(newVNode, container);
```

If you're using JSX:

```jsx
import { render, cloneVNode } from 'inferno';

const vNode = <div className="example">Hello world</div>;
const newVNode = cloneVNode(vNode, { id: 'new' }); // we are adding an id prop to the VNode

render(newVNode, container);
```

### `createPortal` (package: 'inferno')

HTML:
```html
<div id="root"></div>
<div id="outside"></div>
```

Javascript:
```jsx
const { render, Component, version, createPortal } from 'inferno';

function Outsider(props) {
	return <div>{`Hello ${props.name}!`}</div>;
}

const outsideDiv = document.getElementById('outside');
const rootDiv = document.getElementById('root');

function App() {
	return (
  	    <div>
    	    Main view
            ...
            {createPortal(<Outsider name="Inferno" />, outsideDiv)}
        </div>
    );
}


// render an instance of Clock into <body>:
render(<App />, rootDiv);
```

Results into:
```html
<div id="root">
    <div>Main view ...</div>
</div>
<div id="outside">
    <div>Hello Inferno!</div>
</div>
```
Cool huh? Updates (props/context) will flow into "Outsider" component from the App component the same way as any other Component.

### `hydrate` (package: `inferno`)

```javascript
import { hydrate } from 'inferno';

hydrate(<div />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Same as `render()`, but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by `inferno-server`. Inferno will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.

### `findDOMNode` (package: `inferno-compat`)
This feature has been moved from inferno to inferno-compat in v4 forward. No options are needed anymore.

Note: we recommend using a `ref` callback on a component to find its instance, rather than using `findDOMNode()`. `findDOMNode()` cannot be used on functional components.

If a component has been mounted into the DOM, this returns the corresponding native browser DOM element. This method is useful for reading values out of the DOM, such as form field values and performing DOM measurements.
In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid using `findDOMNode()` at all. When render returns null or false, `findDOMNode()` returns null.

### Inferno Flags (package: inferno-vnode-flags)

**VNodeFlags:**
- `VNodeFlags.HtmlElement`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentUnknown`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentClass`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentFunction`
- `VNodeFlags.Text`
- `VNodeFlags.SvgElement`
- `VNodeFlags.InputElement`
- `VNodeFlags.TextareaElement`
- `VNodeFlags.SelectElement`
- `VNodeFlags.Void`
- `VNodeFlags.Portal`
- `VNodeFlags.ReCreate` (JSX **$ReCreate**) always re-creates the vNode

**VNodeFlags Masks:**
- `VNodeFlags.FormElement` - Is from element
- `VNodeFlags.Element` - Is vNode element
- `VNodeFlags.Component` - Is vNode Component
- `VNodeFlags.VNodeShape` - mask for defining type


**ChildFlags**
- `ChildFlags.UnknownChildren` needs Normalization
- `ChildFlags.HasInvalidChildren` is invalid (null, undefined, false, true)
- `ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren` (JSX **$HasVNodeChildren**) is single vNode (Element/Component)
- `ChildFlags.HasNonKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasNonKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes non keyed (no nesting, no holes)
- `ChildFlags.HasKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes keyed (no nesting, no holes)

ChildFlags Masks
- `ChildFlags.MultipleChildren` Is Array


### `renderToString` (package: `inferno-server`)

```javascript
import { renderToString } from 'inferno-server';

const string = renderToString(<div />);
```

Render a virtual node into an HTML string, given the supplied virtual DOM.

## Functional component lifecycle events

| Name                      | Triggered when                                                  | Arguments to callback           |
| -----------               | --------------                                                  | -----------------------         |
| `onComponentWillMount`    | a functional component is about to mount                        |                                 |
| `onComponentDidMount`     | a functional component has mounted successfully                 | `domNode`                       |
| `onComponentShouldUpdate` | a functional component has been triggered to updated            | `lastProps, nextProps`          |
| `onComponentWillUpdate`   | a functional component is about to perform an update            | `lastProps, nextProps`          |
| `onComponentDidUpdate`    | a functional component has performed an updated                 | `lastProps, nextProps`          |
| `onComponentWillUnmount`  | a functional component is about to be unmounted                 | `domNode`                       |

### Using functional lifecycle events

Functional lifecycle events must be explicitly assigned via props onto a functional component like shown below:

```javascript
import { render } from 'inferno';

function mounted(domNode) {
  // [domNode] will be available for DOM nodes and components (if the component has mounted to the DOM)
}

function FunctionalComponent({ props }) {
  return <div>Hello world</div>;
}

render(
  <FunctionalComponent onComponentDidMount={ mounted } />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Please note: class components (ES2015 classes) from `inferno` **do not** support the same lifecycle events (they have their own lifecycle events that work as methods on the class itself).

## Development vs Production modes

By default, Inferno will run in development mode. Development mode provides extra checks and better error messages at the cost of slower performance and larger code to parse.
When using Inferno in a production environment, it is highly recommended that you turn off development mode.

### Running Inferno on Node JS

Ensure the environment variable `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.

### Building Inferno for use in a browser

When running Inferno on the browser using Webpack or Rollup, a replacement will need to occur during your build.

#### Webpack

Use the following configuration in your Webpack build for production build:

```js
  ...
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        'NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
      }
    })
  ]
```

When you are building for development, you may want to use `inferno.dev.esm.js` ("dev:module": "dist/index.dev.esm.js",) file.
That build version has extra level of validation for development purposes. You can use it by adding following code to your webpack config.

```js
    ...
	resolve: {
    /* When doing development workflow we want to make sure webpack picks up development build of inferno */
		alias: {
			inferno: __dirname + "/node_modules/inferno/dist/index.dev.esm.js"
		}
	}
```

#### Rollup

Use the following configuration in your Rollup build:

```js
const replace = require('rollup-plugin-replace');
```

```js
  ...
  plugins: [
    replace({
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production'),
    })
  ]
```

When you are building for development, you may want to use `inferno.dev.esm.js` ("dev:module": "dist/index.dev.esm.js",) file.
That build version has extra level of validation for development purposes. You can use it by adding following code to your rollup config.

```js
    const alias = require('rollup-plugin-alias');

    ...
	plugins: {
    /* When doing development workflow we want to make sure webpack picks up development build of inferno */
		alias: {
			'inferno': __dirname + '/node_modules/inferno/dist/index.dev.esm.js'
		}
	}
```

### Custom namespaces

Inferno always wants to deliver great performance. In order to do so, it has to make intelligent assumptions about the state of the DOM and the elements available to mutate. Custom namespaces conflict with this idea and change the schema of how different elements and attributes might work, so Inferno makes no attempt to support namespaces. Instead, SVG namespaces are automatically applied to elements and attributes based on their `tag name`.

## Goal and Philosophy

<img align="right" alt="Inquirer Logo" src="/assets/inquirer_readme.png" title="Inquirer.js"/>

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the "CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)").

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of
- providing *error feedback*
- *asking questions*
- *parsing* input
- *validating* answers
- managing *hierarchical prompts*

> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).


## [Documentation](#documentation)
<a name="documentation"></a>

### Installation
<a name="installation"></a>

``` shell
npm install inquirer
```

```javascript
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) {
	// Use user feedback for... whatever!!
});
```

<a name="examples"></a>
### Examples (Run it and see it)
Check out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.

``` shell
node examples/pizza.js
node examples/checkbox.js
# etc...
```


### Methods
<a name="methods"></a>
#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
<a name="objects"></a>

#### Question
<a name="questions"></a>
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`.

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter: function () {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers
<a name="answers"></a>
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator
<a name="separator"></a>
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ "Choice A", new inquirer.Separator(), "choice B" ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 > Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

<a name="prompt"></a>
### Prompt types
---------------------

> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/list-prompt.png)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](https://i.cloudup.com/LcRGpXI0CX-3000x3000.png)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-1.png)
![Expand prompt expanded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-2.png)

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `"Disabled"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

---

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

## User Interfaces and layouts


Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

<a name="reactive"></a>
## Reactive interface


Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });

// When you're done
prompts.onCompleted();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(
  onEachAnswer,
  onError,
  onComplete
);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)
<a name="support"></a>

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app
  - iTerm
- **Windows**:
  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
  - cmd.exe
  - Powershell
  - Cygwin
- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:
  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)
  - konsole


## News on the march (Release notes)
<a name="news"></a>


Please refer to the [Github releases section for the changelog](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases)


## Contributing
<a name="contributing"></a>

**Unit test**
Unit test are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Please add a unit test for every new feature or bug fix. `npm test` to run the test suite.

**Documentation**
Add documentation for every API change. Feel free to send typo fixes and better docs!

We're looking to offer good support for multiple prompts and environments. If you want to
help, we'd like to keep a list of testers for each terminal/OS so we can contact you and
get feedback before release. Let us know if you want to be added to the list (just tweet
to [@vaxilart](https://twitter.com/Vaxilart)) or just add your name to [the wiki](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/wiki/Testers)

   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
